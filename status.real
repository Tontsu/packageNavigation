Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14)
Description: Automated Password Generator - Standalone version
 APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
 password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
 Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th
 National Computer Security Conference (NCSC), Oct. 11-14, 1994
 (Volume 1)", http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/nissc/
 1994-17th-NCSC-proceedings-vol-1.pdf, pages 203-216)
 .
 Also note that the FIPS 181 standard from 1993 has been withdrawn by NIST in
 2015 with no superseding publication. This means that the document is
 considered by its publicher as obsolete and not been updated to reference
 current or revised voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, or
 federal data standards.
 .
 apg has not seen upstream attention since 2003, upstream is not
 answering e-mail, and the upstream web page does not look like it is
 in good working order. The Debian maintainer plans to discontinue apg
 maintenance as soon as an actually maintained software with a
 compariable feature set becomes available.

 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.

 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.

 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to
 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the
 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2-utils) or format (docbook-xsl,
 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.
 .
 This package ships with the latest DocBook 4.5 XML DTD, as well as a
 selected set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents, including
 4.0, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

Description: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Depends: init-system-helpers (>= 1.52), libc6 (>= 2.27), libsystemd0 (>= 243), libgamemode0, libgamemodeauto0
Description: Optimise Linux system performance on demand
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package includes a program called '/usr/libexec/gamemode-simulate-game',
 which invokes gamemode, sleeps for 10 seconds and then exits. This allows you
 to test whether gamemode is working properly on your system, it will
 return gamemode's error message if something went wrong, otherwise it
 will exit with a 0 status.

Description: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able
 to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
 and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys
 used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration
 files and only a few options are implemented.

Package: grep
Status: install ok installed
Priority: required
Section: utils
Depends: dpkg (>= 1.15.4) | install-info
Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: module to find differences between files
 Algorithm::Diff is a Perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It can compare two files and find
 the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
 common Unix tool 'diff'.
 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).

 Algorithm::Diff::XS is a Perl diff utility module based on Joe Schaefer's
 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.
 .
 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

 three sets of items, known as the original, left and right, this module can
 take a three-way difference or merge them. Taking a difference provides an
 array reference that is very similar to the behaviour of Algorithm::Diff. One
 can also implement custom conflict resolution using the CONFLICT callback.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: perl
Depends: perl
Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Package: liberror-perl
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: perl

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set

 automation tasks one might want to apply.

Description: GObject based collection and utility library
 libgee is a collection library providing GObject-based interfaces and
 classes for commonly used data structures.
 .
 libgee provides the following interfaces:
  * Traversable
    - Iterable
         + Collection
           # List
             * BidirList
           # Set
             * SortedSet
               - BidirSortedSet
           # MultiSet
           # Queue
             * Deque
         + Map
           # SortedMap
             * BidirSortedMap
    - Iterator
         + BidirIterator
           # BidirListIterator
         + ListIterator
           # BidirListIterator
  * MultiMap
  * Future
 .
 The ArrayList, ArrauQueue, ConcurrentLinkedList, ConcurrentSet, HashSet,
 HashMap, HashMultiSet, HashMultiMap, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, Promise,
 TreeSet, TreeMap, TreeMultiSet, and TreeMultiMap classes provide a
 reasonable sample implementation of those interfaces. In addition, a set of
 abstract classes are provided to ease the implementation of new collections.
 .
 Around that, the API provides means to retrieve read-only views, efficient
 sort algorithms, simple, bi-directional or index-based mutable iterators
 depending on the collection type.
 .
 libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C library.
 It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.
 .

Package: libgsm1

Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4)
Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 An XPS file is in fact a Unicoded ZIP archive using the Open Packaging
 Conventions, containing the files which make up the document. These include an
 XML markup file for each page, text, embedded fonts, raster images, 2D vector
 graphics, as well as the digital rights management information. The contents
 of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which
 supports ZIP files.

 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Package: liblqr-1-0
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: libs
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.2.5), libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.24.0)
Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
 .
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
 Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
 Shamir, which can be found at
 http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

Description: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Package: libmnl0
Status: install ok installed
Priority: important
Section: libs
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14)
Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
 .
 The main features in libmpeg2 are:
 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Section: libdevel
Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided

 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

Description: runtime library for PDF transformation/inspection software
 QPDF is a program that can be used to linearize (web-optimize),
 encrypt (password-protect), decrypt, and inspect PDF files from the
 command-line.  It does these and other structural, content-preserving
 transformations on PDF files, reading a PDF file as input and
 creating a new one as output.  It also provides many useful
 capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
 who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
 about how they work.
 .
 QPDF understands PDF files that use compressed object streams
 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into
 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for
 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,
 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content
 creation or viewing software -- it does not have the capability to
 create PDF files from scratch or to display PDF files.
 .
 This package contains the qpdf runtime libraries required to run
 programs that link with the qpdf library.

Description: efficient, principled regular expression library
 RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
 expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++
 library.
 .
 RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in
 time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that
 searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory. RE2 is engineered to
 use a small fixed C++ stack footprint no matter what inputs or regular
 expressions it must process; thus RE2 is useful in multithreaded environments
 where thread stacks cannot grow arbitrarily large.
 .
 On large inputs, RE2 is often much faster than backtracking engines; its use
 of automata theory lets it apply optimizations that the others cannot.

Description: lightweight RDF syntax library
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
 and writing Turtle and NTriples.
 .
 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
 is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
 reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
 plugins).
 .
 Serd is:
  * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
  * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
    and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
    in every sense.
  * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
    to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
    stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
    In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
    using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the
    input.
  * conformant and well-tested: Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples
    and URI specifications, and includes a comprehensive test suite which
    includes all the normative examples from the Turtle specification, all
    the "normal" examples from the URI specification, and additional tests
    added specifically for Serd. The test suite has over 96% code coverage
    (by line), and runs with zero memory errors or leaks.

Description: library for serialising LV2 atoms to/from Turtle
 Sratom is a new C library for serialising LV2 atoms to/from Turtle.
 It is intended to be a full serialisation solution for LV2 atoms,
 allowing implementations to serialise binary atoms to strings and
 read them back again. This is particularly useful for saving plugin
 state, or implementing plugin control with network transparency.
 Sratom uses Serd and Sord to do the work, it is a small library
 implemented in a single source file, suitable for direct inclusion
 in projects if avoiding a dependency is desired.

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Description: asynchronous event notification library - runtime library
 Libuv is the asynchronous library behind Node.js. Very similar to libevent or
 libev, it provides the main elements for event driven systems: watching and
 waiting for availability in a set of sockets, and some other events like timers
 or asynchronous messages. However, libuv also comes with some other extras
 like:
  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS resolution
  * processes and threads management, and a portable inter-process
    communications mechanism, with pipes and work queues
  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
  * interface with external libraries that also need to access the I/O.
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which you can link
 your program.

Description: Collection of video4linux support libraries
 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 .
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.

 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Description: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,

 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not

 pure black ink instead of composite black in printers that don't do
 color map conversion in firmware.
 .
 HPIJS can take advantage of Ghostscript IJS KRGB support when
 available, to enhance black printing on printers that do color
 map conversion in firmware and are thus not affected by the old
 rss patch.

Depends: debconf (>= 1.5.19), coreutils (>= 5.91), sensible-utils
Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.

 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 xdg-dbus-proxy is a filtering proxy for D-Bus connections. It was
 originally part of the Flatpak project, but it has been broken out as
 a standalone module to facilitate using it in other contexts, for
 example in WebKit-GTK's optional bubblewrap-based sandbox.
 .
 For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
 access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
 AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
 created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
 container).

Description: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
 .
 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Section: utils
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17), liblzma5 (>= 5.2.2)
Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
